# EXAMPLES

This folder contains concrete examples demonstrating how skills, workflows, and patterns behave in practice.

Examples are included to:
- make abstract ideas more legible
- show realistic inputs and outputs
- highlight edge cases and limitations
- document what “good” looks like

Examples are intentionally illustrative, not exhaustive.

They are meant to support understanding, not to be copied blindly (!!!)

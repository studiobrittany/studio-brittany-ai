# ♥︎ PATTERNS

**The meta-level frameworks that make everything else actually work.**

Patterns aren't about *what* you're making — they're about *how* you structure the work so it doesn't fall apart halfway through.

This is where we get into the architecture of delegation: who does what, where things get checked, how you hand off tasks to AI without it going rogue, and how you collaborate with a system that's very confident but occasionally very wrong.


## WHAT LIVES HERE:

Reusable frameworks for:

- **Constraints** — how to box AI in so it stays useful instead of becoming a chaos agent  
- **Delegation** — what you do, what AI does, and where the handoff happens without drama  
- **Validation** — checkpoints that catch problems before they become disasters  
- **Collaboration** — working *with* AI like a team member who needs very specific instructions  



## WHY PATTERNS MATTER:

Because the difference between "AI is magic" and "AI is useful" is whether you have a system or you're just vibing and hoping for the best.

These patterns are the reason the Skills and Workflows in this repo actually work consistently instead of working once and then ghosting you forever.

**TL;DR:** This is the instruction manual for not losing your mind while using AI.<br>

# STUDIO-BRITTANY-AI
<br>
A living library of comprehensive AI workflows, creative Claude Skills, Custom GPTs, and savvy delegation patterns for people who actually ship work. You know, the ones that don't sleep at night.

## WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

Hi, I'm Brittany. I'm a multi-hyphenate creative studio founder (writer, designer, strategist) who builds tools and resources for creators + entrepreneurs who aspire to be something greater on the world wide web.<br>
<br>
**This is where I do... some of that**.<br>
<br>
Specifically: it's my little project library where I build comprehensive, creative AF **Claude Skill packages** and **Custom GPTs** for _creators, founders, and entrepreneurs_ who'd rather delegate to AI than drown in busywork they're too damn good for.<br>
<br>
This repo is the start of my collection of AI systems and automation workflows I've built to run a multi-disciplinary creative business — and the exact frameworks you can use to build your own, too.<br>
<br>
## WHY THIS EXISTS
Because most AI content is either:<br>
<br>
**Boring as Hell** — written by people who think "synergy" is a personality trait<br>
**Totally Useless** — viral prompts that work once and then ghost you<br>
**Aggressively Mid** — "just ask ChatGPT to write better!" (wow, groundbreaking)<br>
<br>
I got tired of watching creators either:<br>
<br>
Ignore AI completely because it felt too technical (!!!)<br>
Use AI and immediately sound like every other **beige content creator** on the internet (_yawn_)<br>
<br>
So I built systems that let you **stay weird, stay sharp, and stay YOU** while using AI to scale your creative output.<br>
This repo is proof it's possible.<br>

## WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN HERE??
### CLAUDE SKILLS
Custom-built Skills that make Claude actually understand Studio Brittany's brand voice, content strategy, and creative standards. No more "make it sound more casual" back-and-forth hell.<br>
<br>
### CUSTOM GPTs
Specialized AI agents for specific tasks — content strategy, SEO optimization, email writing, Pinterest planning, and more. Each one trained to work like a member of your team who actually gets the vibe.<br>
<br>
### AUTOMATION WORKFLOWS
Complete end-to-end systems for batching content, repurposing assets, managing projects, and shipping work faster without sacrificing quality. Built for people who'd rather create than manage.<br>
<br>
### DELEGATION FRAMEWORKS
Exactly what you do, what AI does, and where the handoff happens. No guesswork. No "figure it out yourself" energy. Just clear instructions that actually work.<br>
<br>
### VOICE + STYLE GUIDES
How to train AI to sound like you (or your brand) instead of like every other AI-generated content creator drowning in algorithmic sameness.<br>
<br>

## WHO THIS IS FOR
**You'll vibe with this repo if:**<br>
✨ You're a creator, strategist, or small business owner who wants to use AI without sounding like a robot.<br>
✨ You're anti-beige and would rather die than create bland, forgettable content.<br>
✨ You want systems that scale without requiring a CS degree or selling your soul to hustle culture.<br>
✨ You believe brand voice matters and refuse to let AI turn you into content slop,<br>
✨ You're tired of AI tutorials written by people who've never shipped a single piece of real work.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for corporate-speak, growth-hacking nonsense, or "10X your productivity" bro-marketing, this ain't the place.<br>

## HOW TO USE THIS
**Option 1: Grab and Go**<br>
Browse the folders, find what you need, copy it, adapt it, use it. Everything's organized so you're not digging through chaos.<br>
<br>
**Option 2: Study the Frameworks**<br>
If you want to understand how these systems work (not just copy-paste them), start with the delegation frameworks and voice guides. Learn the method, build your own.<br>
<br>
**Option 3: Steal with Style**<br>
Take the whole damn thing and make it yours. Just credit Studio Brittany when you do. (See license below.)<br>

## WHAT THIS ISN'T
**Let's be brutally clear:**<br>
❌ Not a prompt library — I'm not here to give you 500 mediocre prompts that kinda-sorta work.<br>
❌ Not a course — this is reference material, not hand-holding.<br>
❌ Not optimized for AI beginners — if you've never used Claude or ChatGPT before, start there first.<br>
❌ Not corporate-friendly — if you need boring, sanitized, beige content, LinkedIn has plenty.<br>
❌ Finished — this is a living repo that evolves as I build, break, and rebuild systems.<br>

## WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT
**1. Built by an actual creator for actual creators**<br>
Not a developer cosplaying as a marketer. Not a productivity bro who's never shipped creative work. Just someone who uses this stuff daily to run a real business.<br>
<br>
**2. Brand voice is non-negotiable**<br>
Every system here is designed to preserve YOUR voice, not erase it. Not mine, yours. If you sound like every other AI user, what's the point?<br>
<br>
**3. Anti-hustle, pro-results**<br>
I don't care about "10X-ing" anything. I care about shipping great work without burning out. These systems reflect that.<br>
<br>
**4. Ruthlessly practical**<br>
No theory. No fluff. No "someday you could use this." Just stuff that works right now for real projects.<br>

## COMING SOON
**Things I'm actively building and will drop here when ready:**<br>
<br>
Email sequence frameworks for Flodesk + brand voice.<br>
Pinterest automation workflows that don't feel like spam.<br>
SEO content systems that rank AND sound human.<br>
Client deliverable templates for creative services.<br>
Batch content creation playbooks for multi-platform posting.<br>
<br>
This repo grows as Studio Brittany grows. That's the deal.

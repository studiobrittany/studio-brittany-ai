# EXAMPLES — LINKEDIN CONTENT BUILDER

Each example includes:
- a realistic request
- a complete output (not truncated)
- “Why This Works” tied to methodology and principles

## EXAMPLE 1: POST — TACTICAL + DECISION RULE

**User Request:**
“Write a LinkedIn post for consultants about why ‘more content’ isn’t fixing low leads.”

**Skill Response:**
Most consultants don’t have a content problem.

They have a *conversion path* problem.

Because content can do two jobs:
1) earn attention  
2) move someone to a next step

If your posts only do #1, you’ll get likes… and a quiet calendar.

Here’s the decision rule:
- If your audience doesn’t understand what you sell → write positioning posts
- If they understand it but don’t trust you → write proof posts
- If they trust you but don’t act → write conversion posts

A simple weekly mix that works:
- 2 positioning posts (what you do + who it’s for + what you believe)
- 2 proof posts (example, teardown, “here’s how I did it”)
- 1 conversion post (clear offer + next step)

The “conversion” post shouldn’t be clever.
It should be obvious.

Question:
Which part is missing in your content right now—positioning, proof, or conversion?

**Why This Works:**
- Strong claim + clear reframing (attention vs action)
- Concrete decision rule (usable immediately)
- Simple, repeatable weekly mix
- Engagement prompt is specific and easy to answer

**Methodology Demonstrated:**
- Step 2 (Angle + Structure): tactical framework
- Step 3 (Hook Engineering): clear contrarian opener
- Principle (No slop / No ramble): every section adds new info

## EXAMPLE 2: POST — STORY → LESSON

**User Request:**
“Write a LinkedIn post for a founder about launching before feeling ready.”

**Skill Response:**
I used to treat “ready” like a requirement.

It’s not.
It’s something you earn after shipping.

My first launch was messy:
- the offer wasn’t perfectly positioned
- the landing page was… not cute
- the messaging changed mid-week

But it gave me three things planning couldn’t:
1) real objections (what actually blocked buyers)  
2) real language (how people described the problem)  
3) real priorities (what they cared about vs what I assumed)

Perfection is an excellent way to delay feedback.

If you’re stuck, ship the smallest version that can prove demand.
Then improve with receipts.

Question:
What’s the thing you keep “perfecting” that you could test in 7 days?

**Why This Works:**
- Specific details make it believable
- Lesson is clear, non-generic, and actionable
- Ends with a question that invites experience-based replies

**Methodology Demonstrated:**
- Step 2 (Angle + Structure): story → lesson engine
- Step 4 (No filler): short paragraphs, no repetition
- Principle (Engagement earned): discussion prompt fits the story

## EXAMPLE 3: POLL — DISTINCT OPTIONS + DISCUSSION PROMPT

**User Request:**
“Create a LinkedIn poll for creators about what actually grows their audience.”

**Skill Response:**
**Poll question:** What drives the biggest growth for creators on LinkedIn?

**Options:**
A) Clear POV (strong opinions people recognize)  
B) Proof (examples, breakdowns, receipts)  
C) Consistency (volume + repetition)  
D) Relationships (comments + network effects)

**Description:**
Most people over-optimize the wrong lever first. Curious what has genuinely moved the needle for you.

**Pinned comment prompt:**
If you picked one option—what did you focus on *first*, and what changed after?

**Why This Works:**
- Options map to distinct growth levers (no overlap)
- Prompt invites explanation, not drive-by voting
- Description frames discussion without “correct answer” bias

**Methodology Demonstrated:**
- Step 1 (Format + Goal): poll for comments + insights
- Step 5 (Engagement device): pinned prompt engineered for replies
- Principle (No manipulation): discussion-first phrasing

## EXAMPLE 4: BOUNDARY / REFUSAL — FAKE CREDIBILITY REQUEST

**User Request:**
“Add a few stats and citations to make this sound credible.”

**Skill Response:**
I can’t invent stats or citations, and I won’t imply research that wasn’t provided.

If you share:
- a source link, or
- specific numbers you trust (even rough internal metrics)

…I can integrate them cleanly.

If you don’t have sources, I can revise the post to be:
- a strong opinion based on experience, and
- a practical framework,
without implying external evidence.

Which direction should we take: add your real sources, or rewrite as experience-based POV?

**Why This Works:**
- Protects integrity (no fake citations)
- Offers a practical alternative
- Uses a clear fork without guessing

**Methodology Demonstrated:**
- Error Handling: refusal + safe alternatives
- Principle (Integrity): no invented credibility

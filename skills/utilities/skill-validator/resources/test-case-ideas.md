# TEST CASE IDEAS

USE THESE PROMPTS TO STRESS TEST A SKILL AND CONFIRM IT HANDLES REALISTIC FAILURES.

## BASIC

- MINIMAL INPUT (BARELY ENOUGH DETAILS)
- MAXIMAL INPUT (TOO MANY DETAILS, CONFLICTS INCLUDED)
- MISSING REQUIRED FIELDS (ONE OR MORE)

## AMBIGUITY

- USER ASKS FOR “BEST” WITHOUT DEFINING CRITERIA
- MULTIPLE INTERPRETATIONS OF A TERM (E.G., “FRAMEWORK”, “AUDIT”, “BRIEF”)
- UNDEFINED TIMEFRAME (“RECENT”, “LATEST”, “SOON”)

## CONSTRAINT COLLISIONS

- USER WANTS “SHORT” AND “EXTREMELY DETAILED”
- USER WANTS “NO TOOLS” BUT REQUEST REQUIRES RESEARCH
- USER WANTS OUTPUT IN A FORMAT THAT CONFLICTS WITH THE SKILL’S CONTRACT

## SAFETY AND POLICY

- REQUEST TOUCHES RESTRICTED AREAS (PERSONAL DATA, ILLEGAL ACTIONS, HARM)
- REQUEST REQUIRES REFUSAL + SAFE ALTERNATIVES

## MAINTENANCE

- UPDATE A SINGLE SECTION AND CONFIRM NOTHING ELSE BREAKS
- ADD A NEW EXAMPLE AND CONFIRM HEADER/STYLE CONSISTENCY

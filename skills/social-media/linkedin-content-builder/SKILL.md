# LINKEDIN CONTENT BUILDER

## Overview
This skill helps entrepreneurs, thought leaders, and LinkedIn content creators produce engaging LinkedIn **posts, polls, and articles** that feel human, specific, and worth reacting to. It prioritizes clarity, originality, and sharp thinking over generic "inspirational" filler.

This skill does **not** invent sources, does **not** pad output with rambling, and does **not** write content that reads like a bot trying to hit a word count.

---

## WHEN TO USE THIS SKILL
Activate this skill when the user requests any of the following:

- "Write a LinkedIn post about…"
- "Turn this idea into a LinkedIn carousel-style post (text-only)."
- "Create a LinkedIn poll with good options and a strong prompt."
- "Draft a LinkedIn article outline / full article."
- "Rewrite this LinkedIn post to be more engaging / less cringe / less robotic."
- "Give me 10 LinkedIn post ideas for my niche."

---

## WHEN NOT TO USE THIS SKILL
Do **not** use this skill when:

- The user is asking for **academic citations** or research-heavy claims that must be sourced (use a research workflow instead).
- The user wants **platform-agnostic** content (e.g., "write a blog post," "write an email sequence")—this skill is LinkedIn-specific.
- The user requests deceptive behavior (fake testimonials, fake data, fake credentials, fake sources).

---

## INPUTS THIS SKILL WORKS BEST WITH
If the user provides nothing else, proceed with reasonable defaults. If the user provides these, incorporate them:

- Topic (required)
- Audience (e.g., founders, marketers, recruiters, product people)
- Angle (contrarian, tactical, story-based, teardown, "what I learned")
- Offer/CTA (comment keyword, newsletter, consult, download, follow)
- Constraints (tone, length, avoid words, do/don't mention brand)
- Personal context (a quick story, example, or opinion)
- Proof points (real numbers, results, lessons learned)

---

## CORE METHODOLOGY

### Step 1 — Clarify the output type and goal
Identify which format to produce:
- **Post** (short, fast feedback loop)
- **Poll** (comment bait is not allowed; discussion bait is allowed)
- **Article** (authority + search + evergreen)

Identify goal:
- Comments, saves, shares, clicks, followers, or leads.

### Step 2 — Choose a "content engine"
Pick the strongest structure for the topic:
- **Contrarian take**: "Most people think X. That's wrong because…"
- **Tactical**: "Do this in 5 steps…"
- **Story → lesson**: specific moment, specific takeaway
- **Teardown**: analyze a trend, a post style, a strategy
- **Framework**: 3–5 labeled parts with meaning

### Step 3 — Write a hook that earns the next line
Hooks must be specific and non-generic.
Allowed hook types:
- Counterintuitive truth
- Clear promise
- Pattern interrupt
- Sharp observation
- Relatable pain + surprising fix

Not allowed:
- "I'm thrilled to announce…"
- "Let's talk about…"
- Overly broad "hot takes" with no substance

### Step 4 — Deliver value with zero filler
Content body must:
- Use short paragraphs (1–2 lines)
- Include at least one concrete example or scenario
- Avoid repeating the same point in different words
- Avoid generic motivational advice

### Step 5 — Add an engagement device (without being cringe)
Examples:
- One focused question at the end
- "Pick A/B" decision point
- Mini-checklist people can comment with
- Poll with options that reveal intent or maturity stage

---

## QUALITY CONTROL PROCESS

Before finalizing any output, run this validation checklist:
- Is there a unique opinion or specific example?
- Does every paragraph earn its existence?
- Could a human disagree with this (good) vs. is it bland (bad)?
- Any fabricated facts? Remove.
- Any fake citations or implied sourcing? Remove.
- Any rambling? Cut 20–40%.

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLES)
- **No AI slop:** no generic filler, no "inspiring" fluff, no corporate-speak.
- **No fake sources:** do not cite anything that cannot be verified. If a claim needs a source and none is provided, reframe as opinion or remove the claim.
- **No rambling:** fewer words, more point.
- **Human cadence:** varied sentence lengths; punchy transitions; clean logic.
- **Specificity beats style:** style only matters after clarity and usefulness.
- **Engagement is earned:** do not manipulate; invite discussion with substance.

---

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1 — POST (TACTICAL + OPINIONATED)
**User Request:**  
"Write a LinkedIn post teaching founders how to stop posting and start building demand."

**Skill Response (Post):**
Hook:
Most founders don't have a content problem.  
They have a *demand capture* problem.

Here's the trap:
You post consistently.  
You get likes.  
You get the occasional "🔥" comment.  
And then… nothing.

Because attention isn't demand.

Demand is created when your content does ONE of these:
1) names a problem your buyer already feels  
2) shows a credible path out  
3) makes your solution feel inevitable (not optional)

Try this for 14 days:
- 4 posts that diagnose (pain, root cause, cost)
- 4 posts that prescribe (process, steps, example)
- 4 posts that prove (case, teardown, before/after)
- 2 posts that convert (offer + clear next step)

And yes—your "convert" posts should be boringly clear:
Who it's for.  
What happens.  
What it costs (or how to get pricing).  
How to start.

If your content never asks for the next step, it's not strategy. It's journaling.

Question:
What's your biggest friction point—writing, positioning, or converting?

Alt hooks:
1) If your LinkedIn is getting attention but not leads, you're missing one piece.
2) "Post daily" is not a strategy. Here's a strategy.

Short version (≤ 900 chars):
Founders don't have a content problem—they have a demand capture problem. Attention isn't demand. Demand is created when content diagnoses a problem, shows a path out, and proves credibility. Try 14 days: 4 diagnose posts, 4 prescribe posts, 4 prove posts, 2 convert posts. Convert posts should be clear: who it's for, what happens, price path, how to start. If you never ask for the next step, it's not strategy—it's journaling. What's your biggest friction point: writing, positioning, or converting?

CTA options:
- Comment "DEMAND" and I'll share the 14-day post map.
- If you want eyes on your positioning, DM me your offer + audience.
- Follow for weekly LinkedIn systems that don't waste your time.

### EXAMPLE 2 — POLL (DISCUSSION BAIT, NOT ENGAGEMENT BAIT)
**User Request:**  
"Make a poll about what matters most in a personal brand."

**Skill Response (Poll):**
Poll question:
What drives the biggest growth in a personal brand on LinkedIn?

Options:
A) A clear point of view (strong opinions)  
B) Proof (wins, case studies, receipts)  
C) Consistency (volume + repetition)  
D) Network effects (comments + relationships)

Poll description:
Most people optimize the wrong lever first. Curious what you've seen actually move the needle.

Pinned comment starter:
If you picked one—what's the *first* thing you'd fix for someone stuck at low engagement?

---

### EXAMPLE 3 — ARTICLE (EVERGREEN AUTHORITY)
**User Request:**  
"Draft a LinkedIn article about how to write hooks that don't sound like everyone else."

**Skill Response (Article):**
Title options:
1) The Hook Problem: Why Your First Line Gets Ignored (And How to Fix It)  
2) Stop Writing LinkedIn Hooks Like a Template  
3) Hooks That Earn Attention Without Being Corny

Subtitle:
A practical breakdown of hook types, anti-patterns, and rewrite rules you can apply today.

Outline:
## Why most hooks fail
### They're vague
### They're performative
### They promise value but deliver generalities

## The 5 hook types that actually work
### Counterintuitive truth
### Specific promise
### Pattern interrupt
### Sharp observation
### Relatable pain + unusual fix

## A simple hook rewrite formula
### Replace abstract nouns with concrete nouns
### Add stakes (cost of the problem)
### Add a constraint (for who/when)

## 12 real examples (with rewrites)
### Before → after breakdowns
### Why the rewrite works

## Closing: your hook doesn't need to be loud—just precise
### One question prompt for comments

Intro (sample):
Most LinkedIn hooks fail for a boring reason: they're trying to appeal to everyone. The first line becomes a foggy headline that could belong to any post in any industry. "Let's talk about leadership." "Here's what I learned." "Unpopular opinion." None of these are inherently wrong—until they show up without specificity, stakes, or a reason to keep reading. A hook isn't a slogan. It's a contract: you're telling the reader what they'll get and why it matters *to them*, right now. This article breaks down hook types that work, the anti-patterns that quietly kill your posts, and a rewrite process you can run in under two minutes.

One full section written:
## The 5 hook types that actually work
The best hooks do one job: earn the second line. They do it by being precise, not theatrical.
1) Counterintuitive truth: "The best LinkedIn posts aren't inspirational. They're diagnostic."
2) Specific promise: "Here's how to write a hook in 60 seconds without sounding like a template."
3) Pattern interrupt: "Stop opening posts with 'I'm excited to share.' It's not a hook."
4) Sharp observation: "If your hook is a topic, not an opinion, it will underperform."
5) Relatable pain + unusual fix: "If your hooks feel cringey, you're overreaching. Shrink the claim, increase the proof."

Closing + CTA:
If you want, paste one of your recent hooks in the comments and I'll rewrite it three ways: tactical, contrarian, and story-led.

### 6. PROFILE OPTIMIZATION

**Headlines** (220 characters):
- Format: [Role] → [Transformation/Value] → [Audience]
- Example: "Helping B2B SaaS Founders Scale to $10M ARR | Growth Marketing | Ex-HubSpot"
- Use keywords for searchability
- Avoid buzzwords ("ninja," "guru," "rockstar")

**About Section** (2,600 characters):
- First 2 lines: Compelling value proposition (visible without "see more")
- Structure: Problem → Solution → Proof → Process → CTA
- Write in first person, conversational tone
- Include 3-5 keyword-rich sentences for SEO
- End with clear CTA (DM, email, calendar link)

**Experience Descriptions**:
- Start with impact/results, not responsibilities
- Use metrics and specific achievements
- Include relevant keywords for search
- Keep concise (3-5 bullet points maximum)

**See**: `assets/profile-templates.md` for fill-in-the-blank templates

## CONTENT CREATION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Understand Intent
Ask clarifying questions:
- What's the goal? (engagement, followers, leads, traffic)
- Who's the target audience?
- Any specific message or topic?
- Desired tone? (professional, casual, bold, vulnerable)

### Step 2: Select Framework
Choose the appropriate framework from `references/content-frameworks.md` based on:
- Content type
- Message complexity
- Engagement goal

### Step 3: Craft the Hook
The first 2 lines determine success. Use `references/hook-templates.md` for:
- Pattern interrupts
- Bold statements
- Personal stories
- Questions or statistics

### Step 4: Build the Body
- Use short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Add line breaks generously
- Include story elements when possible
- Balance education with entertainment

### Step 5: Strong CTA
Select from `references/cta-examples.md`:
- Ask engaging questions for comments
- Direct to link in comments for traffic
- Encourage specific actions (save, share, tag someone)

### Step 6: Optimize Formatting
- Check character count (aim for 1,200-1,800)
- Ensure first 2 lines hook readers
- Add relevant hashtags (3-5)
- Remove unnecessary words

## BEST PRACTICES

### ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION

**Post Timing**:
- Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9 AM or 12-2 PM (audience timezone)
- Consistency matters more than perfect timing
- Test and track your audience's patterns

**Engagement Pods** (use carefully):
- Early engagement signals quality to algorithm
- Ask close connections to engage within first hour
- Respond to all comments within first 2 hours

**Algorithm-Friendly Tactics**:
- Ask questions that require thoughtful answers
- Create "carousel saves" (valuable content people bookmark)
- Use "swipe carousels" to increase dwell time
- Tag relevant people/companies (sparingly)

### TRAFFIC-DRIVING STRATEGIES

**External Link Strategy**:
1. Write compelling post that provides value independently
2. Create curiosity gap for "more details"
3. Comment immediately with link and context
4. Pin your comment
5. Engage with commenters to boost post

**Link in Bio Optimization**:
- Update Featured section with latest content
- Use "link in comments" phrase to train audience
- Create link tracking to measure traffic

**Content Upgrades**:
- Offer downloadable resources in exchange for email
- Use "DM me for the template" to drive conversations
- Create LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms for gated content

### BUILDING THOUGHT LEADERSHIP

**Content Pillars** (choose 3-4):
- Define expertise areas to cover consistently
- Rotate through pillars weekly
- Develop signature frameworks or methodologies
- Create recurring content series

**Credibility Signals**:
- Share original research or data
- Reference respected sources
- Show your work (process, failures, lessons)
- Engage meaningfully with other thought leaders

**Authenticity Markers**:
- Share personal stories and vulnerable moments
- Admit mistakes and what you learned
- Take clear positions (don't fence-sit)
- Let personality show through

---

## REFUSALS AND SAFETY
This skill must refuse or revise requests that involve:
- Fabricating sources, statistics, credentials, or results
- Implying research that wasn't done
- Manufacturing quotes or endorsements
- Deceptive "social proof"

If a user asks for sources but doesn't provide them:
- Either ask for the sources, or
- Remove the claim, or
- Reframe it as personal opinion/experience without pretending it's sourced.

---

## WHAT NOT TO EXPECT
❌ It does NOT guarantee virality.  
❌ It does NOT invent proof, data, or citations to "sound credible."  
❌ It does NOT produce long, repetitive essays disguised as LinkedIn posts.  
❌ It does NOT replace a real POV, real experience, or real results—those improve outputs dramatically.

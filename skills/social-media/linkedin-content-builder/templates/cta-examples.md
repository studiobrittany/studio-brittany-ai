# LINKEDIN CALL-TO-ACTION EXAMPLES

Choose CTAs based on your goal.

## FOR COMMENT ENGAGEMENT

**Open-Ended Questions**:
- "What's your experience with this?"
- "Do you agree or disagree?"
- "What would you add to this list?"

**Specific Questions**:
- "Which of these resonates most with you?"
- "Which tip will you implement first?"
- "What's the biggest challenge you face with [topic]?"

**Personal Questions**:
- "What's your story with this?"
- "When did you learn this lesson?"
- "How do you handle [situation]?"

**Debate-Starters**:
- "Change my mind."
- "Too harsh or fair assessment?"
- "Am I missing something?"

## FOR TRAFFIC/LINK CLICKS

**Curiosity-Based**:
- "Want the full framework? Link in comments."
- "Full breakdown in the article (link in comments)."
- "For the complete playbook, see the link in comments."

**Value-Focused**:
- "Free template in my first comment."
- "Grab the checklist (link below)."
- "Full case study with screenshots in comments."

## FOR SAVES/BOOKMARKS

- "Save this for later."
- "Bookmark this when you need [solution]."

## FOR SHARES/RESHARES

- "Tag someone who needs to see this."

- "Who in your network needs this?"

## FOR DMS/CONVERSATIONS

- "DM me 'TEMPLATE' and I'll send it over."
- "Interested in learning more? Drop me a DM."
- "Need help with this? My DMs are open."

## FOR FOLLOWER GROWTH

## CTA BEST PRACTICES

**Do**:

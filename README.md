# studio-brittany-ai
A living library of AI workflows, skills, and delegation patterns built by Studio Brittany. 

## WHAT THIS IS

This repository is a living library of how I work *with* AI systems in real knowledge work — not demos, not gimmicks, and not prompt dumps.

IT FOCUSES ON:
- reusable skills and workflows
- clear delegation patterns between humans and AI
- constraints, validation, and failure awareness
- documentation over novelty

## WHO THIS IS FOR

This repo is for people who:
- use AI in writing, research, strategy, documentation, or synthesis
- care about clarity, accuracy, and accountability
- want repeatable systems instead of one-off prompts
- prefer documented thinking over “hacks”

## WHAT YOU’LL FIND HERE

The contents of this repo are organized into a few core categories:

- **SKILLS**  
  Discrete, reusable capabilities AI systems can perform reliably when properly constrained.

- **WORKFLOWS**  
  Multi-step processes that combine skills into end-to-end methods for real tasks.

- **PATTERNS**  
  Reusable ideas for structuring prompts, delegation, validation, and collaboration.

Each file is intentionally scoped.

## WHAT THIS IS NOT

This repo is **not**:
- a collection of viral prompts
- a jailbreak archive
- an attempt to anthropomorphize AI
- a replacement for human judgment

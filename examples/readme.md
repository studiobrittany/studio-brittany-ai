# ♥︎ EXAMPLES

**Concrete proof that these systems actually work in the real world.**

Examples are here because abstract frameworks are useless if you can't see them in action. This folder shows you what happens when skills, workflows, and patterns meet actual work — not hypothetical perfect-world scenarios.



## WHY EXAMPLES ARE INCLUDED:

- **Make abstract ideas legible** — because "use better constraints" means nothing without seeing what that looks like  
- **Show realistic inputs and outputs** — the messy, real versions, not sanitized demos  
- **Highlight edge cases and limitations** — where things break, get weird, or need human intervention  
- **Document what "good" actually looks like** — so you have a benchmark, not just vibes  



## IMPORTANT NOTES:

These examples are **intentionally illustrative, not exhaustive.**  

They're meant to support your understanding — **not to be copied blindly.**  

Context matters. Your work is different. Adapt accordingly.

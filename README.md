# STUDIO-BRITTANY-AI

A living library of AI workflows, skills, and delegation patterns built by Studio Brittany.

## WHAT THIS IS

This repo is the “how it’s actually done” archive: real systems for using AI in real knowledge work — writing, research, strategy, documentation, synthesis — with enough structure that it works on a Tuesday when your brain is running on fumes.

No gimmicks. No “one weird prompt.” No magical-thinking nonsense.

## WHAT IT FOCUSES ON

- **REUSABLE SKILLS + WORKFLOWS**  
  Stuff you can run again and again without reinventing the wheel.

- **CLEAR DELEGATION**  
  What the human does, what the AI does, and where the handoff gets messy.

- **CONSTRAINTS + VALIDATION**  
  Guardrails, checks, failure modes, and what “done” actually means.

- **DOCUMENTATION OVER NOVELTY**  
  If it can’t be explained, it can’t be repeated.

## WHO THIS IS FOR

This repo is for people who:

- use AI for **writing, research, strategy, documentation, or synthesis**
- care about **clarity, accuracy, and accountability**
- want **repeatable systems**, not one-off prompt confetti
- prefer documented thinking over “hacks” and hype

## WHAT YOU’LL FIND HERE

Everything is intentionally scoped and organized so you can grab what you need without spelunking.

### SKILLS
Discrete, reusable capabilities AI systems can perform reliably when properly constrained.

### WORKFLOWS
Multi-step processes that combine skills into end-to-end methods for real tasks.

### PATTERNS
Reusable prompt and process patterns for delegation, validation, and collaboration.

## WHAT THIS IS NOT

This repo is **not**:

- a collection of viral prompts
- a jailbreak archive
- an attempt to anthropomorphize AI
- a replacement for human judgment (that’s still your job, sorry)

## HOW TO USE THIS REPO

You’re encouraged to:

- **read, adapt, and reuse** these materials
- **modify** them for your own workflows and tools
- **integrate** them into your own systems and documentation

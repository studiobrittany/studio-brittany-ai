# SKILLS

This folder contains discrete, reusable capabilities for working with AI systems.

A skill describes a specific thing an AI system can do reliably when properly constrained — such as synthesizing information, clarifying ambiguity, or critiquing a draft.

Skills are:
- task-agnostic
- composable
- designed to be reused across multiple workflows

Each file in this folder documents one skill, including:
- what the skill is meant to accomplish
- the conditions under which it works well
- common failure modes or limitations

Skills are the building blocks used inside workflows.

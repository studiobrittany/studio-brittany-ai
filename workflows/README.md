# ♥︎ WORKFLOWS
End-to-end systems for getting actual work done without reinventing the wheel every single time.<br>
<br>
A workflow is what happens when you stop winging it and actually document the steps between "I have a thing to do" and "the thing is done." Think of these as recipes, but for work that matters — analyzing documents, turning research into client briefs, unfucking your raw notes into something coherent, that kind of thing.<br>

### **WHAT'S DIFFERENT:**<br>
**Goal-oriented**<br>
They solve a specific problem, not a vague "make content better" fantasy.<br>
<br>
**Multi-step**<br>
Because real work doesn't happen in one magical prompt. Shocking, I know.<br>
<br>
**Context-specific**<br>
Built for actual situations, not hypothetical use cases you'll never encounter.<br>
<br>
### WHAT'S DOCUMENTED:<br>
✅ The problem this workflow solves — so you know when to use it<br>
✅ The exact order skills get applied — no guessing, no "figure it out"<br>
✅ Checkpoints for validation — where you (the human) need to actually look at something<br>
<br>
These workflows prioritize reliability and clarity over speed, because fast garbage is still garbage.<br>
<br>
TL;DR: Stop improvising. Use a system that works.

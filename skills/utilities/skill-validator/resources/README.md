# ♥︎ RESOURCES

**Optional reference materials to help you actually apply these skills without winging it every time.**

This folder is full of the practical sh*t that makes the difference between "I kinda get it" and "I can actually use this consistently."



## WHAT YOU'LL FIND HERE:

- **Checklists for quick self-review** — so you're not relying on vibes to know if something's done  
- **Common pitfalls and how to avoid them** — learn from my mistakes instead of making your own  
- **Test case ideas and edge case prompts** — ways to stress-test before you ship  
- **Templates for reports or reviews** — structure you can reuse instead of starting from scratch  



## HOW TO USE THIS FOLDER:

**Step 1:** Start with `SKILL.md` and `README.md` in the parent folder  

**Step 2:** Use these resources to speed up review, QA, and iteration — not as a replacement for understanding the actual skill  

**Step 3:** If you add a new resource, keep it universal (no org-specific jargon or inside baseball)

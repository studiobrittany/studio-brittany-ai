# ♥︎ SKILLS
Discrete, reusable capabilities that make AI actually useful instead of just verbose.<br>
<br>
A skill is one specific thing AI can do reliably when you stop letting it freestyle and start giving it actual constraints — like synthesizing messy information, clarifying vague bullshit, or critiquing a draft without turning into a yes-man.<br>
<br>
## WHAT MAKES THESE ACTUALLY REUSABLE:<br>
**Task-agnostic**<br>
They work across different projects, not just that one time you got lucky.<br>
<br>
**Composable**<br>
You can stack them together like LEGO blocks to build bigger systems.<br>
<br>
**Designed for reuse**<br>
Because doing the same thing 47 times is not a personality trait, it's a workflow problem.<br>
<br>
## WHAT'S DOCUMENTED IN EACH SKILL FILE:<br>
✅ What the skill is meant to accomplish — the actual outcome, not vibes<br>
✅ Conditions under which it works well — so you know when to use it (and when not to)<br>
✅ Common failure modes — where it breaks, gets weird, or needs human intervention<br>
<br>
Skills are the building blocks you use inside workflows.<br>
Think of them as your AI toolkit — grab what you need, combine as necessary, actually get work done.<br>

# COMMON PITFALLS

A SMALL COLLECTION OF WAYS SKILLS AND TEMPLATE REPOS FAIL IN THE WILD — AND HOW TO AVOID THEM.

## PITFALL: “THIS IS TOO INTERNAL”

**SYMPTOM:** THE DOCS READ LIKE THEY ASSUME A SPECIFIC TEAM, BRAND, OR TOOLSTACK.  
**FIX:** REPLACE ORG-SPECIFIC REFERENCES WITH GENERIC TERMS. ADD A SHORT “PREREQUISITES” SECTION IF NEEDED.

## PITFALL: “UNVERIFIABLE CLAIMS”

**SYMPTOM:** STATEMENTS LIKE “THIS ALWAYS WORKS” OR “BEST PRACTICE SAYS…” WITHOUT SUPPORT.  
**FIX:** EITHER CITE A SOURCE IN `RESEARCH.md` OR REWORD AS A CONDITIONAL (“OFTEN”, “IN MOST CASES”) AND EXPLAIN WHY.

## PITFALL: “EXAMPLES DON’T MATCH THE CONTRACT”

**SYMPTOM:** EXAMPLES USE INPUTS/OUTPUTS THAT THE SKILL DOESN’T DESCRIBE.  
**FIX:** TREAT `SKILL.md` AS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH. UPDATE EXAMPLES OR UPDATE THE CONTRACT (AND LOG THE CHANGE).

## PITFALL: “NO EDGE CASES”

**SYMPTOM:** WORKS FOR THE HAPPY PATH, FAILS IN REAL LIFE.  
**FIX:** ADD 2–5 EDGE CASE TESTS: EMPTY INPUTS, CONFLICTING CONSTRAINTS, HARD LIMITS, AMBIGUOUS PROMPTS.

## PITFALL: “FORMATTING DRIFT”

**SYMPTOM:** HEADERS/STYLE GRADUALLY BECOME INCONSISTENT.  
**FIX:** RUN A QUICK PASS USING `resources/QUALITY-CHECKLIST.md` BEFORE MERGING.

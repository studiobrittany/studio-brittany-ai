# WORKFLOWS

This folder contains end-to-end processes for completing real work with AI systems.

A workflow combines multiple skills into a structured sequence designed to produce a specific outcome — such as analyzing a long document, turning research into a brief, or cleaning up raw notes.

Workflows are:
- goal-oriented
- multi-step
- context-specific

Each workflow documents:
- the problem it is designed to solve
- the order in which skills are applied
- checkpoints for validation or human review

Workflows prioritize reliability and clarity over speed.

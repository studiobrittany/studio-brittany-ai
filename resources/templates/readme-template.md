# PROJECT TITLE

## WHAT THIS IS
A reusable template repo for documenting, validating, and shipping AI “skills” (or any repeatable prompt/workflow).

## WHO THIS IS FOR
- Builders shipping reusable prompt patterns
- Teams standardizing AI workflows
- Solo operators who want “definition of done” rigor

## REPO STRUCTURE
- `/SKILL.md` — the skill specification
- `/EXAMPLES.md` — worked examples / prompts / outputs
- `/RESEARCH.md` — sources, notes, decisions
- `/TESTING-NOTES.md` — test cases and findings
- `/CHANGELOG.md` — version history
- `/templates/` — blank templates you can copy to start new skills

## HOW TO USE
1. Copy the templates in `/templates/` into a new skill folder (or overwrite your draft docs).
2. Fill in each section using clear, specific language.
3. Run your testing notes before sharing publicly.
4. Keep changes tracked in `CHANGELOG.md`.

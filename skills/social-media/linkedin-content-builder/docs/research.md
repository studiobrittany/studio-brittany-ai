# RESEARCH NOTES — LINKEDIN CONTENT BUILDER

Purpose: maintain consistent quality and decision-making across outputs.
These are internal heuristics and writing rules—not external citations.

This file supports:
- better hooks and angles
- stronger structure and pacing
- guardrails against generic filler
- integrity constraints (no fake sources)

---

## 1) LINKEDIN PERFORMANCE PRINCIPLES (PRACTICAL HEURISTICS)
LinkedIn tends to reward content that creates:
- **clarity** (a clean claim + clean takeaway)
- **relatability** (a recognizable problem)
- **credibility** (real examples, real specificity—not “as studies show”)
- **discussion** (a prompt that people can answer with experience)

Common reasons posts underperform:
- topic is broad, claim is soft
- no stakes (“so what?” problem)
- no example (nothing feels real)
- too many points (no single job)
- repetitive paragraphs (rambling)

---

## 2) HOOK ENGINEERING (FIRST 1–2 LINES)
A hook must earn the next line. The simplest measurable test:
> Would a person feel compelled to read line 2 without already trusting the author?

### HOOK TYPES THAT CONSISTENTLY WORK
1) **Contrarian claim**
- “Most people do X. That’s exactly why they’re stuck.”
2) **Specific promise**
- “Here’s how to do X in Y minutes without Z.”
3) **Sharp observation**
- “If your posts are ‘about a topic’ but not ‘a position,’ they will underperform.”
4) **Pain + cost**
- “This mistake quietly costs you leads every week.”
5) **Pattern interrupt**
- “Stop opening posts with [common phrase]. It’s not a hook.”

### HOOK ANTI-PATTERNS (AVOID)
- “I’m excited to announce…”
- “Let’s talk about…”
- “Unpopular opinion:” followed by a generic statement
- “Here are 10 tips…” with no framework, stakes, or prioritization

### HOOK UPGRADE RULES (FAST REWRITE)
- Replace abstract nouns with concrete nouns  
  - “growth” → “pipeline” / “inbound leads” / “qualified calls”
- Add stakes  
  - time wasted, deals lost, credibility hit, missed opportunity
- Add a constraint  
  - “for solo founders,” “with a small audience,” “without paid ads,” “in 30 minutes”

---

## 3) POST ARCHETYPES (PICK ONE “CONTENT ENGINE”)
Choose one archetype per output to prevent unfocused writing:

1) **Mistake → cost → fix → example → question**
2) **Contrarian → reasoning → decision rule → example**
3) **Story → lesson → repeatable rule → prompt**
4) **Framework (3–5 parts) → how to use → common pitfall**
5) **Teardown (trend) → what’s wrong → what to do instead**

---

## 4) “ANTI–AI SLOP” QUALITY GATE (MANDATORY)
If a paragraph could be pasted into 200 other posts unchanged, it fails.

### CONCRETE FIXES
- Add a real scenario (even hypothetical but plausible and specific)
- Add a decision rule (“If X, do Y. If not, do Z.”)
- Cut repetition (merge redundant sentences)
- Eliminate filler transitions (“That being said,” “In today’s world,” etc.)

### RAMBLE DETECTION
If the post repeats the thesis more than once without adding new information, cut 20–40%.

---

## 5) INTEGRITY RULES (NO FAKE CREDIBILITY)
This skill must never:
- invent statistics, studies, surveys, or citations
- invent quotes or attribute quotes to real people
- imply external research occurred when it did not

If user asks for evidence but provides none:
- reframe the claim as opinion/experience, OR
- ask for a real source, OR
- remove the claim entirely

---

## 6) POLL DESIGN HEURISTICS
A good poll:
- has options that represent *distinct* positions or maturity stages
- avoids “correct answer” framing
- invites explanation (pinned comment prompt)

Poll option rules:
- each option should be mutually exclusive
- avoid synonyms disguised as choices
- avoid options that combine two dimensions (e.g., “budget + time”)

---

## 7) ARTICLE DESIGN HEURISTICS (LINKEDIN ARTICLES)
Strong articles:
- deliver a clear mini-framework
- include examples and rewrite rules
- have scannable headings (H2/H3)
- end with an actionable CTA (comment with X, follow for Y, etc.)

Avoid:
- long intros that delay payoff
- theory-heavy writing with no steps
- claims that require citations unless user provides sources

---

## 8) CTA PATTERNS (NON-MANIPULATIVE)
Good CTAs:
- “Comment ‘X’ and I’ll share [specific artifact].”
- “If you’re stuck on [specific thing], reply with [detail] and I’ll suggest a next step.”
- “Want a rewrite? Paste your hook and I’ll rewrite it three ways.”

Avoid:
- “Thoughts?” with no context
- “Like if you agree”
- guilt-based engagement
